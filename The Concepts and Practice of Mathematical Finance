The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance by Mark S. Joshi 

Chapter 1
Risk- kinda like uncertainty
Gov bonds are basically riskless
Market Effeincy- only works until people stop beliving in it and try to take advatage-- It seems that then pricing has to a lot with human pychology and not only the value of a good
Market Effeincy also assumes everyone has same playing feild thus insider trading clearly breaks that and the knowledge gap from big player and household investors will also possibly cause ineffeincy 
Can't get future prices from past prices in the market- Markov prooperty-- so it seems market pricing doesn't have time symmetry,

So we get asset price reflects the riskness of the assset, greater risk = greater movement in a year expectation
Info is unknown until it arrives therefor it can be seen as random, much like superposition how until we take measurement it can't be known with definaive certianty
