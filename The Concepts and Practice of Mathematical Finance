The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance by Mark S. Joshi 

Chapter 1
Risk- kinda like uncertainty
Gov bonds are basically riskless
Market Effeincy- only works until people stop beliving in it and try to take advatage-- It seems that then pricing has to a lot with human pychology and not only the value of a good
Market Effeincy also assumes everyone has same playing feild thus insider trading clearly breaks that and the knowledge gap from big player and household investors will also possibly cause ineffeincy 
Can't get future prices from past prices in the market- Markov prooperty-- so it seems market pricing doesn't have time symmetry,

So we get asset price reflects the riskness of the assset, greater risk = greater movement in a year expectation
Info is unknown until it arrives therefor it can be seen as random, much like superposition how until we take measurement it can't be known with definaive certianty
goal is to cancel out this randomnesss by understanding how one peice of information effects other things so you can cancel out the uncerityanty
basially assumes large entangles systems?? this may be one meathod of modeling?

The risk in bonds is the fact that the intrest rates can change, low rates are band for bonds since if they go up then looses out on money
yeild shows the expectaiton of future rates
